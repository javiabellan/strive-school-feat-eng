# Data Cleaning: Outliers

Detecting Outliers (very rare values) are also important. (by plotting a box diagram, clipping the variable by some percentil, etc). The outliers must be removed from the data so that they do not spoil the models. There are also [advanced methods of outlier detection](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html) that can be taught.

### Day 1: How to encode variables

Exits different ways to encode variables:

- Categorical Variables: Ordinal Encoding, OneHot Encoding, Embedding, ...
- Numerical Variables: MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler (normalization), ...
- Text Variables: BoW, TFIDF

Knowing each one of these encodings is fundamental before creating any model. In addition it is necessary to know which ARE THE BEST CODINGS FOR EACH TYPE OF MODEL for example, for Categorical variables it is better Ordinal enc. for the trees (Random Forest, Boosting), and OneHot for the linear models and neural networks.

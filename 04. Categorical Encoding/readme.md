### Categorical Encoding

On this day we explore less known encoding techniques, mainly this day we talk about the Mean encoding (also known as Target encoding).


- Ordinal Encoding
- OneHot Encoding
- Embedding
- Count Encoding (aka Frequency Encoding)
- Target Encoding (aka Mean Encoding)
- CatBoost Encoding


### Exercises

For practice we will do:
- Do Mean encoding by hand
- Explore [category_encoders](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/) library

# FE for Time Series 

Extracting temporary information when we have a timestamp (a date or date + time) is very important. In this session we work with some temporal dataset to get LAG FEATURES or LAGS.

On this day we also talk about the data leakage because it is very easy to make mistakes and insert data leaks when we extract lags vars.

For practice we will do:
- Manually extract lag features (using the pandas groupby)
- Use libraries like tsfresh
